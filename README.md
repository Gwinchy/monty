Project: 0x19. C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO
Overview
This project is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of two fundamental data structures in computer science: Stacks and Queues. The primary focus is on the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) nature of stacks and the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) nature of queues. By the end of this project, you should have a solid grasp of the theoretical concepts, practical implementations, and real-world applications of these data structures.

1. Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
Understanding how data is managed and accessed is crucial in computer science. Stacks and queues are two classical data structures that play a vital role in various algorithms and applications. This project aims to provide a deep insight into these structures, exploring their properties, use cases, and implementations.

2. LIFO - Last-In-First-Out <a name="lifo"></a>
2.1 Definition
A stack is a data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. This means that the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. Think of it as a stack of plates – you add a plate on the top, and when you need to remove one, you take it from the top.

2.2 Purpose
The primary purpose of a stack is to keep track of function calls, manage recursive algorithms, and handle undo mechanisms. Understanding the mechanics of a stack is crucial for designing efficient algorithms and managing memory effectively.

3. FIFO - First-In-First-Out <a name="fifo"></a>
3.1 Definition
A queue is a data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. In a queue, the first element added is the first one to be removed. Imagine a line of people waiting for a bus – the first person to arrive is the first to board the bus.

3.2 Purpose
Queues are essential for managing tasks in a sequential order. They are widely used in scenarios where tasks should be executed in the order they are received, such as print job management, task scheduling, and breadth-first search algorithms.

4. Common Implementations <a name="common-implementations"></a>
Both stacks and queues can be implemented using arrays or linked lists. The choice of implementation depends on the specific requirements of the application. Arrays offer constant time access to elements, while linked lists provide dynamic memory allocation.

4.1 Stack Implementation
c
Copy code
typedef struct {
    int arr[MAX_SIZE];
    int top;
} Stack;
4.2 Queue Implementation
c
Copy code
typedef struct {
    int arr[MAX_SIZE];
    int front, rear;
} Queue;
5. Use Cases <a name="use-cases"></a>
Understanding when to use stacks or queues is crucial for effective problem-solving. Here are some common use cases for both:

5.1 Stacks
Function Call Management: Stacks are used to manage function calls in recursive algorithms.
Undo Mechanism: Stacks can store the history of actions, facilitating the undo feature in applications.
5.2 Queues
Task Scheduling: Queues are employed in scheduling tasks in the order they are received.
Breadth-First Search: Queues help explore nodes in a breadth-first manner in graph algorithms.
6. Global Variables in C <a name="global-variables"></a>
Global variables are accessible throughout the entire program, and their usage requires careful consideration. While they provide a convenient way to share data between functions, overusing global variables can lead to code that is difficult to understand and maintain.

7. Conclusion <a name="conclusion"></a>
In conclusion, this project provides a comprehensive understanding of stacks and queues, exploring their theoretical concepts, practical implementations, and real-world applications. The knowledge gained here is fundamental for any programmer, laying the groundwork for efficient algorithm design and data management in various applications. Understanding the proper use of global variables in C enhances the overall skill set, contributing to the development of robust and maintainable code.
